"""Module to perform referential integrity checks on two dataframes.

The purpose of these tools is to quickly ascertain what kind of relationship exists
between two dataframe, e.g. many to many, one to many, one to one, etc.
This is useful in an audit scenario as oftentimes the data is not clean and we
may have missing detail records or blanks or duplicates. 

Currently this module only supports providing a list or series of keys to check.
